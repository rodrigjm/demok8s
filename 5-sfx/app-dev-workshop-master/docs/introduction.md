_**SignalFx enables real-time cloud monitoring and observability for infrastructure, microservices, and applications by collecting and analyzing metrics and traces across every component in your cloud environment. Built on a massively-scalable streaming architecture, SignalFx applies advanced analytics and data science-directed troubleshooting to let operators find the root cause of issues in seconds. SignalFx was acquired by Splunk in October 2019. With Splunk’s market-leading log analytics technology, SignalFx and Splunk provide the industry’s first enterprise-grade, end-to-end observability platform.**_

### Act in Real-Time with High-Resolution Metrics

High-resolution metrics drive real-time dashboards, alerts, and insights so you can act before infrastructure performance affects end-user experience

* Build interactive dashboards with up to one-second resolution to get real-time status of infrastructure

* Create prescriptive alerts on hosts metrics or on the performance metrics of an entire cluster

* Quickly troubleshoot a performance bottleneck and drive down MTTR

---

### Scale with Confidence

Modernize your applications and adopt cloud-native infrastructure with confidence. SignalFx is built from the ground up to support hyper-scale requirements of containers, microservices, and serverless architectures

* Analyze performance across 100,000s of dynamic and ephemeral components, multiple deployment environments, application versions, billions of events

* Embrace infrastructure immutability. Deploy infrastructure and monitoring-as-code. Instantly start monitoring high-churn, ephemeral infrastructure components

* Drive closed-loop automation such as auto-scaling cloud environments to ensure a flawless end-user experience

### Continually Improve with High-Cardinality Analytics

Leverage unique insights powered by high-cardinality analytics to optimize infrastructure, application performance and business outcomes

* Dig deep and examine every detail using granular analytics across tens of thousands of dimensions on metric time series

* Aggregate thousands of time series to get the high-fidelity view of the entire infrastructure stack using built-in aggregate functions

* Unlock the value of data science by leveraging SignalFlow Analytics, a data-flow-oriented programming language syntactically similar to python, to express complex data computations with a large library of built-in functions

### Analyze Every Transaction, Focus on What Matters Most

SignalFx Smart Gateway observes every transaction across distributed services and uses machine learning algorithms to define a true anomaly.

* Never miss an anomaly – Deliver flawless end-user experience by catching performance outliers across all the microservices;
* Cut through the noise – Using statistical computations, Smart Gateway cuts through the noise and enables you to focus on the traces that matter;
* Capture one-in-a-thousand issues – Traditional APM tools use random and probabilistic sampling resulting in missing important diagnostic data when it is needed the most – during troubleshooting. The SignalFx Smart Gateway intelligently captures every edge case, such as p(99) outliers, so you can confidently address intermittent issues.

### Quickly Isolate the Root Cause
SignalFx provides a unified, single-pane-of-glass view of infrastructure and applications monitoring – all contextual and fully correlated.

* Narrow down the root cause within seconds to infrastructure, PaaS or application code;
* Correlate how infrastructure performance is impacting application performance;
* Navigate to the application code-level insights within seconds using contextual alerts pointing to the relevant traces;
* Reduce MTTR and enable DevOps practices by having a single source of truth across infrastructure and deployed microservices.
