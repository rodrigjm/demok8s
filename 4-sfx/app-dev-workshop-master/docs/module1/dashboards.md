### 1. Introduction to the SignalFx environment â€¨
Logon to the SignalFx organization you have been invited to

Hover over _**DASHBOARDS**_ in the top menu, and then click on All Dashboards at the bottom and you will see a number of prebuilt dashboards

![](../images/M1-l1-1.png)

If you are getting metrics already through cloud API integration or the Smart Agent you will see relevant dashboards for the services you are getting metrics for in SignalFx.

Among the dashboards there you will see a Dashboard group called Sample Data. This group exists by default in all SignalFx accounts. Let's take a closer look at it.

---

### 2. Inspecting the Sample Data

In the All Dashboards window expand the Sample Data dashboard group by clicking on it, and then click on Intro to SignalFx dashboard
 
![](../images/M1-l1-2.png)

You will see a selection of sample charts. To learn more about charts you can click on the Intro to SignalFx, Part 1, 2 and Part 3 dashboards and read the description of the charts and its metrics.

Let's take a look at the Sample charts. Click on the Sample charts dashboard name:

In the SAMPLE CHARTS dashboard you see a selection of charts that shows the different styles, colours and formats you can apply to the different visualisations available.

---

### 3. Editing charts

Click on the three dots (...) on the Latency histogram chart (circled in the screenshot above) and then on Open. You will see the plot options, current plot and signal (metric) for the Latency histogram chart.

***

Click on the different chart type icons to explore each of the visualizations
![](../images/M1-l1-5.png)
 
See how the chart changes. You can use different ways to visualize your metrics - you choose which chart type fits best for the visualization you want to have.
For more info on the different chart types see: [Choosing a chart type](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/charts/chart-planning-creating.html#choosing-a-chart-type)

Click on Line chart type and you will see the line plot.

In the PLOT EDITOR tab under Signal you see the metric demo.trans.latency we are currently plotting.

---

### 4. Creating a new chart
Let's now create a new chart and save it in a new dashboard! Click on the plus icon and from the drop down, click on **Chart**

![](../images/M1-l1-8.png)
 
You will now see a chart template like the following. 

![](../images/M1-l1-9.png)

***
 
Let's enter a metric to plot. We are going to use the metric `demo.trans.latency`

In the **PLOT EDITOR** tab under **Signal** enter `demo.trans.latency`

![](../images/M1-l1-10.png)

You will instantly see a number of Line plots, like below. The number `18 ts` indicates that we are plotting 18 metric time series in the chart.

![](../images/M1-l1-11.png)

Click on the ***DATA TABLE** tab

![](../images/M1-l1-12.png)

You see now 18 rows, each representing a metics time series with a number of columns. If you swipe over the plot horizontally you will see the metrics in these columns at different times.
In the demo_datacenter column you see that there are two data centers, Paris and Tokyo, for which we are getting metrics.

---

### 5. Filtering and Analytics

Let's now select the Paris datacenter to do some analytics - for that we will use a filter.

Let's go back to the PLOT EDITOR tab
Click on Add filter, wait until it automatically populates, choose `demo_datacenter`, and then Paris

![](../images/M1-l1-13.png)

In the F(x) column, add the analytic function Percentile:Aggregation, and leave the value to 95 (click outside to confirm)

![](../images/M1-l1-14.png)

For info on the Percentile function and the other functions see [Analytics reference](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/reference/analytics-docs/analytics-reference.html )

---

### 6. Using Timeshift analytical function
Let's now compare with older metrics. Click on `...` and then on Clone in the dropdown to clone that Signal

![](../images/M1-l1-15.png)

You will see a new row identical to A, called B, both visible  and plotted

![](../images/M1-l1-16.png)
 
For the B Signal, In F(x) add the analytic function Timeshift and enter 7d (7 days = 1 week), and click outside to confirm

![](../images/M1-l1-17.png)

Click on the cogwheel  on the far right, and choose a color, say pink, from Plot Color, to change color for the plot of B

![](../images/M1-l1-18.png)
 
Click on Close
 
Click on the field next to Time and choose Past Day from the dropdown

![](../images/M1-l1-19.png)

We now see datapoint for A for the last day (rolling) as a blue plot, and 7 days ago in pink 

![](../images/M1-l1-20.png)

Click on Area chart icon

![](../images/M1-l1-21.png)

We now have a better view of our two plots

---

### 7. Using formulas

Let's now plot the difference of all metric values for a day with 7 days between

Click on Enter Formula then enter A-B (A minus B) and hide (deselect) all Signals using the eye, except C

![](../images/M1-l1-22.png)
 
We now see only the difference of all metric values of A and B being plotted. We see that we have some negative values on the plot because a metric value of B has some times larger value than the metric value of A at that time.
If you click on DATA TABLE you can swipe horizontally along the X axis to see the metric values at different times.

Let's apply another function to get the values of C to positive values.
By doing so we will the difference between the metric values for a period of 24 hours with 7 days between. This difference can be used to see an alarming trend if we consider last week to be a baseline (the bigger the number - the more we deviate from the baseline) - but mainly we do this for you to get a bit more training on using functions...

In the PLOT EDITOR for C click on Add Analytics and choose Absolute Value

![](../images/M1-l1-23.png)
 
You will see the C plot now having only positive values

![](../images/M1-l1-24.png)

---

### 8. Overlaying metrics and events
Let's now overlay metrics and events to our initial plot to see if there is any correlation with high latency

To discover and add new metrics to the chart from the ones that are being sent to SignalFx already, click on Browse on the bottom of the screen
Then, in the Metrics sidebar on the right, enter "demo" and click on the search icon to search.

Observe that the Find Metrics option is pre selected

![](../images/M1-l1-25.png)
 
The metrics search is showing 3 metrics with demo in the name

Select demo.trans.count and click on the Add Plot green button

![](../images/M1-l1-26.png)
 
Click on the blue eye icon next to C to hide that Signal, and on the greyed eye icon for Signal A to show it

Filter the Paris datacenter (see step 12 above if you need help with this) and function percentile 95 (see step 13 above) and enter 1h in the Time frame for the entire chart

![](../images/M1-l1-27.png)
 
We see that there is a correlation between latency and number of transactions! Hooray!
Likewise we could check Find Events and find events like deployment events etc. to correlate with.

Click on the icon to collapse the Metrics sidebar

### 9. Introduction to SignalFlow
Let's take a look at SignalFlow - the analytics language of SignalFx that can be used to setup monitoring as code.

Click on View SignalFlow

![](../images/M1-l1-29.png)

You will see the SignalFlow code that composes the chart we were working on

![](../images/M1-l1-30.png)
 
SignalFlow is the analytics language of SignalFx. Between the many benefits it provides, it can be used to setup monitoring as code. In the next lab we will see it being used in action.
For more info on SignalFlow see
[Getting started with SignalFlow](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/getting-started/concepts/analytics-signalflow.html#signalflow-analytics-language)

Click on View Builder to go back to the UI Signal builder

### 10. Adding charts to dashboards 

Let's now save our chart. Click on Save as... and enter a name for your chart, use your initials like `<your initials>'s Latency Chart` and click OK

![](../images/M1-l1-32.png) 
 
In the next window, find your email address in the list and select it, then click Ok

![](../images/M1-l1-33.png) 

You will immediately be transported to the dashboard created under your selected group (make sure the group name on the top left is your email) 

Last but not least, change the dashboard's name, by clicking the ... icon on the top right and selecting Dashboard Info

![](../images/M1-l1-34.png) 

Enter a new name for your dashboard and click on Done

![](../images/M1-l1-35.png) 

Congratulations! You have created your first chart and dashboard!
