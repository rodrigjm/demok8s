### 1. Learn how to configure muting your alerts
There are times when you, for a period of time, don't want to be disturbed by notifications for some non critical alerts. For that you can use muting rules in SignalFx. Let's create one!

Hover over **ALERTS** in the menu and click on **Detectors**

If you created an alert detector in "Working with Detectors" you can click on the three dots `...` on the far right and click on **Create Muting Rule...**

![Create Muting Rule](../images/module2/create-rule.png) 

In the Muting Rule window check Mute Indefinitely and enter a reason. This will mute the rule permanently until you come back here and uncheck this box.

Click Next and in the new modal window confirm the muting rule setup

Click on Mute Indefinitely to confirm. You won't be receiving any email notifications from you alert detector until you resume notifications again.
